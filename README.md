I am a partially self-taught web developer based out of Austin, TX. 
Usually you can find me experimenting with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript; 
dabbling with SWIFT and React.JS; and reading a variety of emerging tech subjects. 
When Iâ€™m not online, you can find me at a local music show or enjoying the great outdoors
